# EuroTwenty16
EuroTwenty16 Universal app built with React

## The Stack 
EuroTwenty16 was built using React, Redux, Express and Redis. React handles the initial server render. 
This webapp was built to be light weight and provide current scores as fast as possible. Redis is used as a primary datastore and is updated periodically using Kue task manager.
